# Exercise 8: BI Visualizations & Analytics

## Objective
Create data visualizations and business intelligence dashboards.

## Files
- `weather_dashboard.py` - Streamlit dashboard (to be implemented)
- `weather_analytics.py` - Analysis scripts (to be implemented)
- Complete pipeline infrastructure

## Planned Features
- 📊 Temperature evolution charts
- 🚨 Alert distribution analysis
- 🗺️ Geographic heat maps
- ⏰ Real-time dashboards
- 📈 Historical trend analysis

## Technology Stack
- Matplotlib/Plotly for charts
- Streamlit for web dashboard
- Pandas for data analysis
- HDFS stored data as source

## Usage (Future)
```bash
# Start visualization dashboard
streamlit run weather_dashboard.py

# Generate analysis reports
python weather_analytics.py
```

## Data Sources
- HDFS stored alerts from Exercise 7
- Real-time Kafka streams
- Aggregated metrics from Exercise 5

## Implementation Status
🚧 **Exercise 8 is prepared for implementation** 
The infrastructure is ready, visualization components can be built on top of the established data pipeline.
